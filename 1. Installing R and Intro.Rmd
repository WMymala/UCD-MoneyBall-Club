# What is R?

* https://www.r-project.org/about.html

* https://skdeshpande91.github.io/wharton_moneyball/more_resources.html

Downloading R: 

R download mirrors: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

* Offical link to download coding language to your computer

RStudio download: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download

* IDE (Integrated development environments) to work on R code

# Creating objects and vectors
x <- 5
* Creates an object x with value 5
* 
x <- 6
* Overwrites original x value with value 6

y <- c(1,2,3,4)
* Creates a vector of 4 values
* length() tells us how many elements are in the vector
* class() tells us the type of element the object is
* length(y) would output "4"
* class(y) would output "numeric"

# Importing datasets 
* This is the majority of how we will be using data in R, rather than just creating the datasets
* To import datasets, go to File -> Import Dataset -> Choose either From Excel or From Stata depending on the type of dataset you are using
